# Thoughts on archiving

I am arhiving this (and the related repositories - [yts_torrents](https://github.com/makkoncept/yts_torrents) and [yts.am_scraper](https://github.com/makkoncept/yts.am_scraper_)). There are several reasons but the most prominent one being that some people might use it for torrenting unsanctioned copyrighted material. As mentioned in the disclaimer, this was not the goal. Maybe this was the reason that I have not thought about this project since the time it was put on Github and therefore it's very outdated and might not even work out-of-the box.
